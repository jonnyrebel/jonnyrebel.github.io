    <p>In the this article I will review 2 good websites and 1 bad website. The first Website I will talk about is <a href="https://www.espn.com">ESPN</a>.This is a good website for many reasons.Fritsly becuase of the structure of the website. It is well formatted and provides all the major links you would be looking for. It keeps the scores at the top of the page and links to all the sports on the left. Any major Article that they want to promote is in the center so that they can get more attention.The coding is modern and well organized. Navigation is very easy and it is easy to find exactly the information i would be looking to read about.There is minimal coloration other than the ESPN logo and head bar that is black and red. This works however because the main draw is the links to articles and not what colors are showing. The page works well on both big and small screens by moving some information into drop down menus.Specifically I like the minimalistic ads that are set off to the side where you can still see them but they are intruding on my experience on the website.
    The next website I will review is <a href="https://www.nfl.com">NFL</a> This website is another good one that I enjoy using. It allows me to find the Denver Broncos and information about them very easily. While scorlling through the major coloration fits the theme of the NFL logo being red white and blue. They include major articles and information on the fornt about the upcoming draft as well as links in the top drop down to get to important news about teams, players, and stats. The coding looks confusing and they use many things ive never seen before however it works well and teh website navigates easily with no problems. Specifically what makes this website better than others is that for the audiience it is reaching; the do not go above and beyond trying to make things complicated or make it hard to get to exactly the information one would be looking for. The stats page is in depth as well as every player having information about them. Overall NFL has a good website that I would return to all the time.The last website I will be reviewing is <a href="https://www.gamesgames.com">gamesgames.com</a> This website is very bad because it uses tables and just throws games at you with no organization. There are pop-ups and each game has long ads. The organization is very poor and there is little about this website that is pleasing to the eye. Much of the coding is just links to other websites that the games are on. There are too many different things going on. The page does work and the links work however with the ugly structure and poor design this website is not good. For the audience the site is trying to reach i can see why they skate by with such poor design. Overall I believe that organization and ability to find what you want on a website is the most important aspect. Most of the coding for these websites was more complicated than what we have practiced. </p>
