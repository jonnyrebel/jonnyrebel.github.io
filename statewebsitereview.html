<h1>State website review</h1>

<h2><a href="https://alaska.gov">1.Alaska</a></h2>
  <p> I alike Alaska's website the best becasue it keeps all the most important information on the front page. It provides the services that it can help provide along with alerts and sections that will guide you to what you need to access as a resident, business, visitor, and state employee. The website is not the most visually pleasing but in personal preference im not going to a state website for what it looks like. the website loads fast and works well on a split screen as well as full.

  <h2><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov">2.Nebraska</a></h2>
  <p> Nebraska's webpage is organized and not cluttered. They have links that will guide you to finding what you need. It is visually pleasing and minimalistic making it easy to navigate. You are able to find what you need fairly quickly and also provides you with information about upcoming events.The secondary links are alphabetically organized making it easy to find information on drivers licenses.(ex)

    <h2><a href="https://www.illinois.gov">3.Illinois</a></h2>
    <p>Illinois' webpage is unique because they have a virtual assistant as the first part of the main page. it does a good job at navigating you to exactly what you need. However the main page is very long when in split screen compared to fullscreen. Some of the links take up the whole page along with very large and unsatisfying pictures. It does have a link to finding local sex offenders on the front page which I though was pretty cool. The page is overall fast to use and in the middle of the pack becasue its easy to use page but ugly design.

      <h2><a href="https://delaware.gov">4.Delaware</a></h2>
      <p> First of all Delaware's main page is extensivly long when in split screen. It has information right at the front that is not really useful unless it is the specific item you are looking for. The guides to finding what you need are very big and it can take a while to scroll until you find exactly what you need. The site is not good looking as everything seems to just be thrown together. When in full screen the site does look more pleasing. The page is also not as long as before but they still feature items at teh top that are not very important to the average user.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.myflorida.com">5.Florida</a></h2>
        <p> Florida's page is so minimalistic that it has almost nothing on its front page. All it has is a search engine and a way to contact them. The backround color does not reach all the way to the edge of the screen when in split mode so there is a white margin around it. At the top of the page it has a link that says skip to main content that literally just scrolls the screen down past the heading to the search engine that you can see already without clicking it. The page is ugly and not useful as it doesn't guide you to what you need. You have to already know exactly what it is you need to. This site is the worst because it isnt useful at all.
