<h1> hosts review</h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.godaddy.com">Goddaddy</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The cost is fairly cheap for a .com domain at $0.01 for the first year </li>
    <li>They have services for aquiring up to 500 domain names at once, help with transfer of domains and also explain why its important</li>
    <li>The web sites design is very clean and easy to manuver and access what I was looking for.</li>
    <li>Have many different packages for web hosting and guarentee of 99.9 percent up time</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a href="http://bluehost.com">Bluehost</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blue host .com plan is 12.99 a year</li>
      <li>They have a large frequently asked questions to help explain what they can provide and how thye can help</li>
      <li>they have options for shared hosting, VPS hosting, and dedicated hosting</li>

    </ul>
    <h2><a href="https://fatcow.com">Fatcow</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Have 371 new domains available</li>
        <li>$4.08 a month deal on the front page but has their most basic plan as $49/yr </li>
        <li>Has oodles of storage and bandwidth</li>
        <li>Many cow puns that make the site funny</li>
    </ul>

<p>My top pick is <a href="http://godaddy.com">Godaddy</a> because they offer a cheap service that has much of the same capabilities that the other sites have. They also have good explanations that help make sense of what
  im going to be getting and why I need it.</p>
